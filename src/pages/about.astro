		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-accent">Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			CIELO-G Learning is an innovative educational platform built around a gamification framework 
			designed to democratize Earth Science education. We believe that complex scientific concepts 
			become more accessible and engaging when presented through interactive, game-like experiences.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-accent">The CIELO-G Framework</h2>
		<p>
			Our framework transforms abstract Earth Science concepts into tangible, memorable learning 
			experiences by integrating:
		</p>
		<br>
		<ul class="mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
			<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Making scientific concepts relatable through narrative</li>
			<li><strong>Interactive Challenges</strong> - Hands-on activities that reinforce learning</li>
			<li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong> - Immediate feedback that guide understanding</li>
			<li><strong>Adaptable Modules</strong> - Content that works across different educational contexts</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-accent">About This Platform</h2>
		<p>
			This website serves as an official implementation of the CIELO-G Learning framework. Here you'll find 
			interactive Earth Science courses organized by topic, each designed with gamification 
			principles to enhance engagement and retention. Our courses cater to diverse audiences, 
			from classroom settings to public outreach programs.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Whether you're an educator seeking to transform your Earth Science curriculum, a student 
			exploring our planet's mysteries, or a researcher interested in science communication, 
			CIELO-G Learning provides tools and experiences that make Earth Science education more 
			inclusive and impactful.
